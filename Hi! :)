Hi!! 

Since we started talking again, I’ve been meaning to say this.

It’s been around 399 days, 9,576 hours, and over 34 million seconds since we broke up. That’s a lot of time, and honestly, I didn’t expect us to cross paths again the way we did. But I’m glad we did.

When I mentioned the idea of trying again, I was being honest, but now I’m also seeing how much you’ve changed. You speak differently now, carry yourself differently. You’ve clearly grown a lot. And I really admire that.

But if I’m being real, there’s also a part of me that feels a bit sad about it — because some of that growth makes me feel like maybe you don’t see me the same way anymore.
Your growth makes me proud, but part of it feels like hindi mo na ako gusto like before.
Still, I respect it. And I respect you.

I also want to say sorry. For how things ended, sa mga hindi ko nasabi noon, and for anything I could’ve done better. Nagbago rin ako, maybe hindi sa ibang parts pero I know I've become more mature now. 

One thing that didn’t change, though, is your smile.
It’s always been something that stood out to me — not in a cheesy way, just in a way that made things feel lighter. It still does. Wala lang, gusto kl lang isingit na kahit sobrang gulo ng isip ko, pag napapadaan ka tas ngumingiti, parang kumakalma yung isip ko.

Right now, I don’t fully know what is going on between us. I’m figuring it out as I go. Whether it leads somewhere or we just stay in each other’s lives in a different way, I’m okay with that. I’m just grateful we’re here — talking, existing in each other’s space again.

Whatever happens, I see you. And I appreciate you genuinely. I hope you know I care about you, if need mo ng any kind of help, I'm always here:)
PS:  (I'm sorry if ang random, I just really wanted tell you what is on my mind)
